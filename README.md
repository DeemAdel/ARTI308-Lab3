Dataset Overview:

Number of rows: 1025

Number of columns: 14

After checking for duplicate rows, 723 duplicate records were found. These duplicates were removed to ensure accurate analysis, leaving a final cleaned dataset with 302 unique patient records.

Missing Values:

There are no missing values in any column of the dataset, making it complete and suitable for further analysis.

Key Observations:

The variable thalach (maximum heart rate achieved) shows a strong correlation with the target (presence of heart disease) variable.

Other features such as cp (chest pain type) and oldpeak also show noticeable relationships with heart disease.

Data Distribution:

Most patients are in the 40–60 years age range.

Cholesterol (chol) and resting blood pressure (trestbps) values are concentrated around moderate levels.


The dataset is clean, well-structured, and ready for further predictive modeling, such as classification tasks to predict heart disease.
